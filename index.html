                        I can bring a well-rounded skill set designed to bridge creativity, technology, and strategic
                        planning. With expertise in media relations, employee engagement, and cross-functional
                        collaboration, I ensure seamless communication and alignment across teams. My proficiency in
                        administrative management and event planning guarantees smooth execution of large-scale
                        initiatives.

                    <p>
                        On the creative side, I excel in digital content production, video and photo editing, and
                        utilizing tools like Figma to craft compelling visuals. My background in copywriting and
                        document workflow management adds further value by ensuring clarity and professionalism in all
                        communications.

                    <p>
                        I leverage my technical proficiency with tools such as Microsoft Office, SharePoint, Asana,
                        Trello, and ERP systems to streamline operations and drive efficiency. With a keen eye for data
                        analytics and an understanding of marketing strategies, I deliver actionable insights and
                        measurable results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether managing content, improving processes, or building engagement, I thrive in dynamic
                        environments that demand innovation and precision.

                        employee engagement for a workforce of over 12,000 employees across nine business units. By
                        implementing targeted communication strategies via email and the intranet, I fostered a more
                        connected and informed workforce.</p>

                    <p>I spearheaded a complete revamp of the intranet's user interface, introducing prototypes for new
                        HR services, innovative ideas, contests, and a TV section. Additionally, I enhanced gamification
                        elements with over 50 features and launched a merchandise shop for employees.</p>

                        objectives. By leveraging data-driven insights, I implemented targeted communication initiatives
                        and direct marketing strategies to enhance employee engagement.</p>

                    <p> I also led the successful consolidation of five SharePoint-based intranet platforms into a
                        unified in-house solution, significantly improving resource accessibility and overall employee
                        satisfaction.</p>

                        and feedback to ensure effectiveness. I organized and executed up to 30 events annually,
                        fostering employee involvement and reinforcing the company’s values, mission, and culture.</p>

                    <p>Additionally, I streamlined learning and development systems, overseeing the maintenance and

            <p>I worked with Sergei in 2020-2023 during the development and launch of a new intranet product at X5 Retail Group, the leader in food retail in Russia. Sergei managed content and employee communications, successfully building a community of engaged platform users.
            He also introduced gamification strategies that significantly boosted engagement. Sergei contributed to the product’s growth and evolution by ensuring all tasks were completed on time and aligned with the project goals. His efforts had a noticeable impact on employee interaction and engagement with the new platform.</p>

            <p>Sergei joined our Comms&CSR team in 2010 and during his time at Deutsche Bank he proved himself to be a true Comms professional with a strong focus on internal communications and intranet management. Sergei supported the team in organizing corporate events locally and abroad and creating engaging newsletters that kept employees informed and connected.
